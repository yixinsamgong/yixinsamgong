### Hi this is Yixin ðŸ‘‹

I am a junior full-stack software engineer and recent graduate of Flatiron School with a background in art history and more than five years of experience in art-related organizations and hospitality industry. I am very passionate about innovations and how creative ideas come into being. Throughout the years I have drawn sketches, written essays on paintings, and curated art exhibitions, however, nothing is more exciting nowadays than developing my web applications and learning new trends in software engineering. A fast learner with inquisitiveness, I am a detailed and goal-oriented team player and look forward to solving problems with others in a creative way. I am proficient in Javascript, React, CSS, HTML, and Ruby on Rails, and currently pursuing Python and Java.
